I have even seen CPD cars stroll right through instead of yielding to pedestrians.  Please put a traffic light there or have a police officer sit there and hand out tickets.,walks,CENTRAL AV & W 8TH ST,Central Av,West End,"I agree. This occurs every day. Sometimes when you are in the crosswalk cars won't even slow down, let alone stop. The new parking spaces make it dangerous to cross at this intersection. Please place a stop sign there to make it possible for pedestrians to cross the street. Place a ""stop for pedestrian sign"" in the middle of the road, then post an officer to give tickets when vehicles do not stop. The parking spots make the cars park at an angle so that pedestrians have to walk out into the street to see if it's clear to cross. Especially if trucks are parked near the crosswalk. Not uncommon for cars to stop or even park in front of crosswalk, next to the curb on the Centennial side of the street. i echo the previous comment.
I routinely experience people not paying attention or not caring and rolling on through the crosswalk.
I have actually seen someone go though and accelerate making intentional extra noise.

Take the extra steps to the crosswalk in front of Clark Montessori and live to tell the tale! I ride a bike through here almost everyday, usually coming up delta and right onto Erie. It?s by far the most dangerous pedestrian intersection in eastern Hyde park. Definitely agree. Drivers never see pedestrians crossing and therefore don?t yield. It is so dangerous. I avoid crossing here. Totally agree- I?ve had several issues at this corner agree! Agree - the walk signal comes on when folks have green arrows to turn into the walking lane... seems very dangerous. I agree even when I get the walk light I can hear cars going faster to run it.

Can the city install fading lights in the road or in adjacent posts? Cars simply do not stop for pedestrians here. Also, most cars are speeding which makes it even more dangerous to use this crosswalk. 100% agree! I live within viewing distance of this crosswalk. Speed is a serious issue. This is a 30 mph, most drive between 40 and 50. This means there?s no reaction time to see and stop for pedestrians. Equally dangerous to pulling into our driveway. Agree Cars drive way too fast here and don't stop.  The sign in the road doesn't help.  There needs to be more done. The new signage has helped. The city should consider making a pedestrian island with the 'yield to ped. in crosswalk' sign. Agree. Driver compliance with this crosswalk is dismal. The pedestal in-street sign has helped, and I thank whomever is responsible for its addition. My neighbor was actually hit by a driver here. Recent efforts have helped somewhat, but there is still room for improvement on the signage and signaling. Agree with all other comments, it is still a dangerous intersection.  Is Observatory a 2 or 4 lanes? At one point someone added some orange flags. They were kept on the telephone pole. But it looks like the city decided that they had to be removed. This allowed people to wave the flag while they were walking. After countless years and good recent Efforts by the city, we still have a dangerous intersection. Please install a system that would force people to stop. This intersection has been an issue for years.  We need a traffic signal here and the entire problem will go away Agree!

It seems that way too many drivers speed through the business district here as they do all along the length of Ludlow I agree, this is a very dangerous set of of intersections Whitfield is generally viewed as the end of the business district by speeders as they exit down the hill. More needs to be done to discourage speeders and protect residents crossing the street in this area as there is only one crosswalk to use. Agree!   Shuttle stop needs moved away from Ludlow further down Whitfield,  when shuttle stops other left turning cars behind it get trapped in the intersection. Also, the detector loop on Whitfield, on the north side, has been non-functional for years and has not been replaced. As a result, the light on Ludlow turns red every cycle all day long, wasting countless hours of drivers' time and much fuel. The position of the crosswalk across Ludlow, in the middle of the intersection, seems strange. Cars illegally turn right on red here all the time, sometimes proceeding north jogging from the southern leg of Whitfield to the north, which means they are driving straight across the intersection against the red light."

There were 3 accidents at this point/intersection within the last 6 months.  Police were seen at 2 - not all accidents are reported - this should be considered.
